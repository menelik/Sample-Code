About Project
=============

Three .PHP files containing sample code that I have written for an online newspaper here in Saudi Arabia, called Al-Sharq. Due to the tight deadline and budget, the client specifically requested a customized WordPress theme, and wanted it to be as easy as possible to be updated. Therefore we decided to use Canvas as the base for the theme, which we heavily customized.

Note
-----

To distinguish the code that I have written, from Canvas's code, I have left the following comments to indicate where my code begins and ends:

* '//My Code Begins Here:' or '<!--My Code Begins Here: --> denotes where my code starts
* '//My Code Ends Here:' or '<!--My Code Ends Here--> denotes where my code ends
*  the fully functional website can be seen here: http://www.alsharq.net.sa/
* You will notice some Arabic text in the source code.

Why I'm proud of this project
-----------------------------

This project gave me a chance to use WordPress custom taxonomies, post types and loops in fun and creative ways. It also allowed me to develop for Arabic content; a welcomed opportunity to use my second language. Being fluent in Arabic has always been an advantage.
